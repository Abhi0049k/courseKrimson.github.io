A <code>command line interface (CLI)</code> is a text-based user interface used to interact with a computer system.
It uses commands to perform tasks, such as creating files or installing programs.
CLIs are useful for automation and troubleshooting, and they can be more efficient than graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for certain tasks.
They were commonly used in the past with systems like Unix, MS-DOS, and Apple DOS, and are still used today by software developers and system administrators.
